5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar); // Returns 6

myVar = myVar * 5; // same as
myVar *= 5;

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from 
considering it as an end of string quote by 
placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is 
learning JavaScript\".";
// return: Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

goodStr = ' Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?" '; 
badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"'; // Throws an error

We can also use the += operator to concatenate 
a string onto the end of an existing string variable. 
This can be very helpful to break a long string 
over several lines.

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";

myStr += "This is the second."

In JavaScript, String values are immutable, 
which means that they cannot be altered once created.
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the 
contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does 
not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the 
individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed.

var lastName = "Lovelace";


lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable 
and can be changed freely.
var myArray = [15, 23, 42];
myArray[0] = 11;  // in return, myArray=[11, 23, 42]

15.
var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11

16.
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is 
via the push() function.
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);
// arr is now [1,2,3,4]

17.
.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of 
an array. We can store this "popped off" value by 
assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() 
removes the last element from an array and returns 
that element.

var threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
var oneDown = threeArr.pop();
console.log(oneDown); // Returns 6
console.log(threeArr); // Returns [1, 4]

18.
.shift() works just like .pop(), except it removes the 
first element instead of the last.

19.
.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding 
the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds 
the element at the beginning of the array.

// Variables which are declared within a function, 
as well as the function parameters have local scope. 
That means, they are only visible within that function.

22.
It is possible to have both local and global variables with 
the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes 
precedence over the global variable.
